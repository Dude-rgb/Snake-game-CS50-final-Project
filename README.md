## - 🧠 About the idea of ​​the game 🧠

As i followed the games track and i'm also passionate about retro games, so i decided to produce my version of the snake game.
When I was in the middle of development I decided to create something more, as I am an enthusiast in the field of artificial intelligence, I went after creating the AI ​​play option, however as I do not have all the knowledge about, I soon used a simpler device. What I used was a simple algorithm that observes which direction brings the character closer to the apple, giving the slight impression that the character knows what he is doing.
moreover, I decided to add some things in the right game that would make it more difficult, since I removed the collisions with the tail.

## - 👾 About the game 👾

In this version of snake game we have two choices:

1. Human Play
   - You can play normally, how in the original game.
2. Ai play
   - the machine plays the game.
     In this version of the snake game I chose to remove the snake's collision with the tail and add some obstacles, of which are:

- <strong>Bananas:</strong>
When you collide with one of them your score decreases 1 point, if you collide several times and your score is less than 0 you lose.
There are a total of 11 bananas and they all remove 1 from your score.<br>
when you crash into a banana, your time does not restore and all bananas and apples are moved.
<br></br>

      <img src="./images/banana.gif" style="width: 800px; height: 500px"/>
   </center>
<br></br>

- <strong>Apple:</strong>
When you touch a apple your score increases by 1, however there are 11 apples on the map and only one increases your score the other 10 do absolutely nothing.<br>
when you collide with an apple your time is restored and all the apples and bananas are moved from position.

      <br><br>
      <img src="./images/apple.gif" style="width: 800px; height: 500px"/>
   </center>
<br></br>

- <strong>Fast 1:<strong>
Fast 1 is a blue region present in 3 regions of the map, where when there is a passage over this obstacle its speed increases by 1, resulting in a speed of 2, however this obstacle can be used to gain an advantage, helping for example to arriving before 5 seconds on an apple, or it can harm, as for example end up passing the wall or hitting a banana.

   </center>
<br></br>

- <strong>Fast 2:<strong>
Fast 2 has the same foundation as fast 1 so that in this case it increases its speed to 3.

## - 🤔 How to play 🤔

1. First you need to select the mode of game, case you want to to play press `ENTER` else case you want to see the machine playing press `SPACE`.<br>
<center>
<img src="./images/initial.png" style="width:500px; height:300px"/>
</center>

2. After choosing your game mode, if it has the human play (`ENTER` command) then you must use the arrow keys to change the snake's direction.<br>
   `!ATTENTION!`

<p style="margin-left:50px;">When the game starts you have 3 seconds of invincibility after that the timer starts counting your 5 seconds, if you manage to get the right apple in this time your timer restarts and all apples and bananas, besides be careful also with bananas, all remove one point from your score, restore all positions of apples and bananas and finally keep your accountant by counting your time.</p><br><br>

3. Otherwise if you choose Ai play you simply need to watch the machine trying to win the game.<br>
`!NOTE!`
<p style="margin-left:50px;">All obstacles and features that you had in Human play are present in Ai play except the control with the arrow keys</p><br><br>
<br><br>

4. While the game is running you can return to the home screen using the `Backspace` key or if you want to exit just use the `ESC` key.<br><br>
